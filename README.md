# CMPT 353 Project
Hello TAs.

My code, datasets, and report is all in this repository.

All my datasets are hardcoded so it is straightforward to run.

My code runs on Windows so I just open up the script and press F5 to run it.

I think in Linux it is $python FILENAME.py

Make sure all your datasets are in the same folder as the code. Exactly how it is set up in this repository.

Thank you,

Leo
